# Pizza Runner Challenge
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Pizza Runner Challenge by Danny Ma! In this project, I had the opportunity to showcase my skills in data cleaning, handling null values, and providing actionable insights to improve the delivery performance of Pizza Runner, a fictitious pizza delivery company.

## About the Challenge
The Pizza Runner Challenge presented a dataset that required extensive cleaning and processing to ensure that accurate insights could be drawn from it. The goal of the challenge was to identify patterns and trends in the data that could help optimize the delivery performance of Pizza Runner.

## My Approach
To handle the data, I employed a systematic and comprehensive analysis that included the identification and removal of null values, data validation, and data normalization. Once the data was cleaned and processed, I analyzed the patterns and trends to extract actionable insights that could improve delivery performance and customer satisfaction.

## Limitations
While I was not able to complete all parts of the challenge, I did successfully clean the data, handle null values, and provide actionable insights. I faced some challenges during the project, and I would appreciate any assistance or guidance to help me further develop my data cleaning and analysis skills.

## Conclusion
The Pizza Runner Challenge provided me with an excellent opportunity to showcase my data cleaning and analysis skills and provide valuable insights to a real-world business problem. I look forward to applying these skills to more challenges in the future and making a meaningful impact in the business world.
